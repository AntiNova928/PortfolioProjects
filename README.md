## PortfolioProjects

1) Created a simple SQL query based on YouTube trending videos from 2017-2018
   - Wanted to know if there are any correlation between the trending videos and the type of content being put out
   - Created a simple data exploration tool in SQL to explore on how to break down the data and gain insightful knowledge
   - Optimized the dataset by creating CTE and CREATE TABLE to ensure that there are no repeated data

## Context:

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. 

According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year."

Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.

## What is this about?

I wanted to learn more about the application of SQL query and how SQL helps data analyst to obtain insightful data to help businesses. Hence, I decided to learn on how to create a simple SQL query based on trending videos on YouTube from 2017-2018.
