## PortfolioProjects

1) [Created a simple SQL data exploration based on YouTube trending videos from 2017-2018](https://github.com/AntiNova928/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SQL%20Query%20for%20Trending%20Youtube%20Video%20Stats%20v1.sql)
   - Wanted to know if there are any correlation between the trending videos and the type of content being put out
   - Created a simple data exploration tool in SQL to explore on how to break down the data and gain insightful knowledge
   - Optimized the dataset by creating CTE and CREATE TABLE to ensure that there are no repeated data

2) [Created a simple SQL data cleaning project on Nashville Housing](https://github.com/AntiNova928/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20for%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)
   - Implemented SQL Queries to clean up data 
   - Some of the queries include: Standardizing the date format, property address data and removing duplicate
   

## What is this about?

I wanted to learn more about the application of SQL query and how SQL helps data analyst to obtain insightful data to help businesses. 

Hence, here are a few SQL projects that I have decided to do up.
1) Creating a simple SQL data exploration based on trending videos on YouTube from 2017-2018
2) Cleaning data in SQL for housing in Nashville
