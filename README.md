Created a simple SQL query based on YouTube trending videos from 2017-2018

Context
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. 
According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). 
Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. 
Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.
